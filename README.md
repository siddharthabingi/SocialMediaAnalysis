# SocialMediaAnalysis
Are you using the right social media analytics tools to monitor, assess and improve your social media performance?

What social media analytics are you measuring and what should you be measuring in your social media tracking?

Monitoring your social media analytics can make the difference between the success or failure of your social media presence.

The Social Media Analytics Compass

The compass contains the essential areas that you need to monitor for your social media channels.

It’s not possible to monitor everything across every channel due to limitations of the tool and it’s not essential to monitor everything depending on the business.

From this compass pick out what’s important for your business and identify a relevant tool to provide the relevant reports.
